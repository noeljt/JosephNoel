This is my personal website to display my experience and ability as a web developer.  
  
## Performance  
This website is hosted on a free heroku server and may take a minute to start up from inactivity, not due to any script performance issues.  
On a large screen, this website will use parallax scrolling (which is awesome), but the feature is disabled on smaller screens as mobile browsers handle it poorly.
